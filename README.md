### Ramanujan Number Game 🤖👨‍💻

Welcome to the **Ramanujan Number Game** repository! This project is an exciting battle between a robot and a human to identify Ramanujan numbers. It is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a quick overview:

### How to Play 🎮

1. **Human vs Robot**: The game pits a human player against a robot. Each player takes turns proposing numbers.
2. **Ramanujan Number Check**: The game checks whether the proposed numbers are Ramanujan numbers.
3. **Scoring**: The first player to propose a valid Ramanujan number earns 1 point. The game continues until one player reaches the winning score after the ten trials.
4. **Projects**: This is our first model about our [Math Games Project](https://github.com/users/Moriarty001/projects/1/views/1).
5. **Version**: This code is the first version (v0.0.1) of this part of game. So, it's always in development in our lab.

### Features ✨

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engaging and interactive interface for both players.
- **Real-time Scoring**: Instant feedback on the validity of the proposed numbers.
- **Educational**: Learn about the fascinating Ramanujan numbers while having fun.
